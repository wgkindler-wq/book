# Proposed Illustrations for Dimension One

## 1. Interaction of Points and Vectors
**Visual:**
A horizontal line representing the real line $\mathbb{R}$.
- Mark the origin $0$.
- Mark a point $v$ (e.g., at 2). Draw an arrow starting at $0$ and ending at $v$. Label this arrow "vector $v$".
- Mark another point $x$ (e.g., at 5). Mark the point $x+v$ (e.g., at 7). Draw an arrow starting at $x$ and ending at $x+v$. Label this arrow "translation by $v$".
- Use different colors or styles for points (dots) and vectors (arrows).

**Description:**
Visualizing a vector $v$ as a translation. The arrow from the origin to $v$ represents the vector in standard position. The arrow from $x$ to $x+v$ represents the same vector acting as a translation on the point $x$. Both arrows represent the same geometric object (the vector $v$).

## 2. Shapes as Equivalence Classes
**Visual:**
A horizontal number line.
- Show an interval $A = [1, 2]$. Shade the region on the line and label it "$A$".
- Show a translated interval $B = [4, 5]$ (translated by +3). Shade the region on the line and label it "$B$".
- Draw a curved arrow from $A$ to $B$ labeled "Translation".
- Include text indicating "Shape $[1, 2]$".

**Description:**
A geometric shape is defined as an equivalence class of sets under translation. The sets $A$ and $B$ are distinct subsets of $\mathbb{R}$, but they represent the same geometric shape because one can be translated into the other. The shape is the abstract object representing all such translated intervals.

## 3. Geometric Properties and Invariance
**Visual:**
Two configurations on a number line (or stacked lines).
- **Configuration 1:** Two points $P$ and $Q$. Draw a bracket or brace between them labeled with their distance $d = |Q-P|$.
- **Configuration 2:** The translated points $P+v$ and $Q+v$. Draw a bracket or brace between them labeled with the same distance $d$.
- Text annotation: "Distance is invariant under translation".

**Description:**
Geometric properties are invariants of tuples under translation. The distance between two points is a property of the pair $\{P, Q\}$ that remains unchanged when the pair is translated to $\{P+v, Q+v\}$. This invariance allows us to define distance as an intrinsic property of the geometric object (the pair of points) itself, independent of its absolute position.
