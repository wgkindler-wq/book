\chapter{Affine Spaces and Vectors: A Geometric Foundation}

\section{Introduction: From High School Geometry to University Mathematics}

In high school geometry, we often think of vectors as ``arrows'' that have a length and a direction. We learn that two arrows are ``equivalent'' (or represent the same vector) if they have the same length and direction, even if they start at different locations.

In this chapter, we formalize this intuition using the language of $\mathbb{R}^n$. We will see that vectors can be thought of as ``translations'' or ``shifts'' of the space, and that many geometric properties we are familiar with (like congruence) are simply properties that remain unchanged when we shift figures around.

This geometric foundation will prove essential in Chapter 3 when we introduce the O notation for comparing functions via norms, and in Chapter 4 when we define derivatives as linear approximations.

\section{Points and Translations in $\mathbb{R}^n$}

\subsection{The Space $\mathbb{R}^n$}
We define the space $\mathbb{R}^n$ as the set of all $n$-tuples of real numbers:
\[ \mathbb{R}^n = \{ (x_1, \dots, x_n) \mid x_i \in \mathbb{R} \} \]
Elements of $\mathbb{R}^n$ are called both \textbf{points} and \textbf{vectors}, and we use these terms interchangeably. The dual terminology reflects the fact that elements of $\mathbb{R}^n$ can be viewed either as locations in space (points) or as displacements from the origin (vectors).

\subsection{Vector Addition}
Given two vectors $x = (x_1, \dots, x_n)$ and $y = (y_1, \dots, y_n)$ in $\mathbb{R}^n$, we define their \textbf{sum} by adding corresponding components:
\[ x + y = (x_1 + y_1, \dots, x_n + y_n) \]
This operation is inherited from the component-wise structure of $\mathbb{R}^n$ and satisfies familiar properties such as commutativity ($x+y = y+x$) and associativity ($(x+y)+z = x+(y+z)$).

\subsection{Translations (Shifts)}
A fundamental operation in this space is moving from one point to another.
Given a fixed vector $y \in \mathbb{R}^n$, we define the \textbf{translation} (or shift) map $S_y: \mathbb{R}^n \to \mathbb{R}^n$ by:
\[ S_y(x) = x + y \]
where the sum $x+y$ is the vector addition defined above.
Intuitively, this map shifts the entire space by the vector $y$.
If $K \subseteq \mathbb{R}^n$ is a shape, its translation is:
\[ S_y(K) = \{ x+y \mid x \in K \} \]
We denote this simply as $K+y$.

\section{Shapes as Equivalence Classes}

\subsection{Motivating the Concept of Shape}
When we think about geometry, we often want to discuss ``shapes'' in $\mathbb{R}^n$. A first attempt at formalizing this concept is to say that a shape is simply a subset of $\mathbb{R}^n$.

For example, the circle of radius 1 centered at the origin in $\mathbb{R}^2$ can be defined as:
\[ C_0 = \{ (x, y) \in \mathbb{R}^2 \mid x^2 + y^2 = 1 \} \]

But here's a question: what about the circle of radius 1 centered at the point $(2, 1)$?
\[ C_{(2,1)} = \{ (x, y) \in \mathbb{R}^2 \mid (x-2)^2 + (y-1)^2 = 1 \} \]

Are these two different shapes? Intuitively, they are the \textit{same} shape—a circle of radius 1—just positioned at different locations. We don't want the location to matter when defining what a ``shape'' is.

\subsection{Congruence by Translation}
To formalize the idea that $C_0$ and $C_{(2,1)}$ are the ``same shape,'' we introduce the notion of \textbf{congruence by translation}.

Two subsets $K, L \subseteq \mathbb{R}^n$ are said to be \textbf{congruent by translation} (denoted $K \cong_T L$) if there exists a vector $y \in \mathbb{R}^n$ such that $K+y = L$.

This connects to high school geometry: two shapes are ``congruent'' if you can pick one up and place it on top of the other. In this context, we restrict to pure translation (no rotation).

\textbf{Example:} The two circles $C_0$ and $C_{(2,1)}$ are congruent by translation. Indeed, if we translate $C_0$ by the vector $y = (2, 1)$, we get:
\[ C_0 + (2,1) = \{ (x+2, y+1) \mid x^2 + y^2 = 1 \} = \{ (u, v) \mid (u-2)^2 + (v-1)^2 = 1 \} = C_{(2,1)} \]

\subsection{Shapes as Equivalence Classes of Sets}
Congruence by translation is an equivalence relation on the collection of subsets of $\mathbb{R}^n$ (it is reflexive, symmetric, and transitive; we omit the proof here as it follows straightforwardly from the properties of vector addition).

To make congruent sets count as the \textit{same} shape, we define a \textbf{shape} to be an equivalence class under this relation. That is, a shape is not a specific subset of $\mathbb{R}^n$, but rather a collection of all subsets that are congruent by translation to one another.

Under this definition, the circles $C_0$ and $C_{(2,1)}$ belong to the same equivalence class, so they represent the same shape: ``a circle of radius 1.''

\subsection{Generalizing to Tuples of Points}
The concept of congruence by translation can be generalized in an obvious way to tuples of points or even to tuples of sets. For instance, two pairs of points $(x_1, x_2)$ and $(y_1, y_2)$ could be considered congruent if there exists a translation $v$ such that $x_1 + v = y_1$ and $x_2 + v = y_2$.

This generalization is particularly useful when we want to study geometric objects that are defined not just by a single set, but by relationships between multiple points or sets.

\subsection{Arrows: A Useful Special Case}
A particularly important application of this idea is to \textbf{arrows}. In high school physics or geometry, we often draw ``arrows'' to represent vectors. An arrow has a starting point and an ending point.

Consider two points $x, z \in \mathbb{R}^n$. We can draw an arrow starting at $x$ and ending at $z$. Intuitively, we say that the arrow from $x$ to $z$ represents the same vector as the arrow from $x'$ to $z'$ if they are parallel and have the same length.

Mathematically, we can formalize this using the concept of congruence: two pairs of points $(x, z)$ and $(x', z')$ should be considered equivalent (represent the same arrow) if there exists a translation that maps $x$ to $x'$ and simultaneously maps $z$ to $z'$. This happens precisely when $z - x = z' - x'$.

\subsection{Formal Definition: Arrow Equivalence}
We define a relation $\sim$ on the set of pairs of points $\mathbb{R}^n \times \mathbb{R}^n$.
We say that $(x, z) \sim (x', z')$ if:
\[ z - x = z' - x' \]

This is an \textbf{equivalence relation} (it is reflexive, symmetric, and transitive).

\begin{proof}
We verify the three properties of an equivalence relation:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Reflexivity:} For any pair $(x, z)$, we have $z - x = z - x$, so $(x, z) \sim (x, z)$.
    
    \item \textbf{Symmetry:} If $(x, z) \sim (x', z')$, then $z - x = z' - x'$. This implies $z' - x' = z - x$, so $(x', z') \sim (x, z)$.
    
    \item \textbf{Transitivity:} Suppose $(x, z) \sim (x', z')$ and $(x', z') \sim (x'', z'')$. Then $z - x = z' - x'$ and $z' - x' = z'' - x''$. By transitivity of equality, $z - x = z'' - x''$, so $(x, z) \sim (x'', z'')$.
\end{itemize}
\end{proof}

\textbf{Geometric Intuition:} The condition $z - x = z' - x'$ is equivalent to saying $z' - z = x' - x$, meaning the quadrilateral formed by points $x, z, z', x'$ is a parallelogram. This visually shows that the arrows have the same direction and length.

\begin{center}
\begin{tikzpicture}[scale=1.2]
    % Define points
    \coordinate (x) at (0,0);
    \coordinate (z) at (2,1);
    \coordinate (xp) at (3,0.5);
    \coordinate (zp) at (5,1.5);
    
    % Draw arrows
    \draw[-latex, thick, blue] (x) -- (z) node[midway, above left] {$v$};
    \draw[-latex, thick, blue] (xp) -- (zp) node[midway, above left] {$v$};
    
    % Draw parallelogram
    \draw[dashed, gray] (x) -- (xp);
    \draw[dashed, gray] (z) -- (zp);
    
    % Label points
    \node[below left] at (x) {$x$};
    \node[above left] at (z) {$z$};
    \node[below right] at (xp) {$x'$};
    \node[above right] at (zp) {$z'$};
    
    % Show that both arrows represent the same vector
    \node[below] at (2.5, -0.5) {Both arrows represent vector $v = z - x = z' - x'$};
\end{tikzpicture}
\end{center}

We define an \textbf{arrow} to be an equivalence class under this relation.

\subsection{Representing Arrows}
An arrow (as an equivalence class of pairs of points) can be represented in two useful ways:

\textbf{1. As a vector in $\mathbb{R}^n$:} Each equivalence class corresponds to a unique displacement vector $v \in \mathbb{R}^n$. Specifically, the equivalence class of the pair $(0, v)$ contains all pairs $(x, z)$ such that $z-x = v-0 = v$. Thus, we can identify an arrow with the vector $v = z - x$ for any representative pair $(x, z)$ in its equivalence class.

\textbf{2. As a drawn arrow:} Each equivalence class can be visualized by drawing an actual arrow from any point $x$ to the point $z = x + v$. Different choices of starting point $x$ give different visual arrows, but they all represent the same equivalence class (the same ``abstract arrow'').

\subsection{Worked Example: Equivalent Arrows in $\mathbb{R}^2$}
Consider the following pairs of points in $\mathbb{R}^2$:
\begin{itemize}
    \item $(x_1, z_1) = ((1, 2), (4, 5))$
    \item $(x_2, z_2) = ((0, 0), (3, 3))$
    \item $(x_3, z_3) = ((-1, 1), (2, 4))$
\end{itemize}

We compute the displacement vectors:
\begin{align*}
z_1 - x_1 &= (4, 5) - (1, 2) = (3, 3) \\
z_2 - x_2 &= (3, 3) - (0, 0) = (3, 3) \\
z_3 - x_3 &= (2, 4) - (-1, 1) = (3, 3)
\end{align*}

Since all three pairs yield the same displacement vector $(3, 3)$, they all belong to the same equivalence class. They represent the same arrow, which can be identified with the vector $v = (3, 3)$, even though the actual drawn arrows start and end at different locations.

\section{Geometric Properties}
A property $\mathcal{P}$ of subsets of $\mathbb{R}^n$ is called a \textbf{geometric property} (with respect to translations) if it is invariant under translation.
That is, if a set $K$ has property $\mathcal{P}$, then for any shift $y$, the set $K+y$ also has property $\mathcal{P}$.
\textbf{Examples:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item ``Being a sphere'' is a geometric property.
    \item ``Containing the origin'' is \textbf{not} a geometric property (since shifting it might move the origin outside).
\end{itemize}
This formalism allows us to distinguish between intrinsic properties of a shape (like volume, shape type) and extrinsic properties (like position).

\section{Chapter Summary}

In this chapter, we established the geometric foundations for working in $\mathbb{R}^n$:

\textbf{Key Definitions:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Translation/Shift:} The map $S_y(x) = x + y$ that shifts space by vector $y$
    \item \textbf{Congruence by Translation:} $K \cong_T L$ if $\exists y: K+y = L$
    \item \textbf{Vector as Equivalence Class:} Vectors are equivalence classes of arrows under the relation $(x,z) \sim (x',z') \iff z-x = z'-x'$
    \item \textbf{Geometric Property:} A property invariant under translations
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Key Results:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item The relation $\sim$ is an equivalence relation (reflexive, symmetric, transitive)
    \item Each equivalence class corresponds to a unique vector in $\mathbb{R}^n$
    \item Geometric properties capture the intrinsic nature of shapes, independent of position
\end{itemize}

These concepts provide the foundation for defining norms and distances in Chapter 2, which in turn enable the O notation (Chapter 3) and derivative definitions (Chapter 4).
