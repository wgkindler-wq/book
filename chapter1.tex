\chapter{Affine Spaces and Vectors: A Geometric Foundation}

We view calculus as a fundamental tool for understanding geometry. To begin this journey, we must first discuss the basic notions of geometry that will serve as our foundation. This chapter focuses on the geometry of $\mathbb{R}^n$, providing essential intuition about its structure and offering a modern perspective on the nature of geometry itself.
